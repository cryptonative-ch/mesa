# Strategy for mesaIDO

Overall strategy is to change masa to a tool for doing IDOs


## Strategy Transition, with gnosis protocol 1 (GP 1)

1. Fork mesa
2. Strip everything away not needed for IDOsÂ 
3. Change this version iteratively to a better UX for IDO usage
4. Build tools for IDO Project

## Strategy New UX, with GP 1

1. Research costumers need/design a new UX tailored to IDO
2. Fork mesa
3. Implement the new UX
4. Build tools for IDO Project


## Strategy New UX and new protocol, with GP 1.5

1. Develop with gnosis a new GP version only for IDO
2. To speed up innovation cycles deploy new contract for every IDO (xdai?)
3. Build a fixed fee into the contract to generate income
4. Run resolver only once every step on a stepping-bonding-curve
5. Add some form of sell lock to not allow dumping token for low-buyers or distribute token after. (they will dump later!?)
6. Auto distribute coins and delete contract


## Generate Revenue?

* Over Service? 0SS https://github.com/martinkrung/dxdao/blob/main/mesa/ido_packages.md
* Fee based? (Blockchain way)

## Outlook: Strategy IDO Suite

Make other protocols for IDOs:

- Revoke DutchX!
- Explorer what's participant understand in fair?
